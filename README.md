# FS-SP17-Lab2
# Lab 02: 99 Lines of Code In The File - Part 1

##### Depot/U

###### Full Stack: Spring 2017

## Info

* This lab consists of two parts

* Today you will be doing most of the logic/coding

* You will also get started on the graphical appearance

## Objectives

* Create an array called `friends`. It will hold five of your friends'

names.

* For every friend in the friend array, you will want to `console.log` the descending chorus of this brand-new, never before seen song 100 times. The lyric must include your friend's name, and must be grammatically correct when we get down to 1. See the example output for more information.

* In the HTML, set the page title to 99 Lines of Code In The File

* Put an `h1` in the html body that says My Singing Friends

* Put a `div` in the html body with a class of `friend`.

* Inside the `div`, put 5 `p`.

* Inside each `p`, put Test1, Test2, Test3, etc.

* Style the page

* Set a background color on the page

* Change the text color of the h1

* Set a background color for class `friend`.

* Target the paragraphs inside the `friend` class div and make them uppercase using only CSS

## Hints

* You will need to use two loops to accomplish this task

* One loop is nested inside the other
